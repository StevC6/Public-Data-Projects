# Python Data Cleaning & Transformation Notebook (Without Pandas)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I perform several **data manipulation and cleaning tasks using pure Python**, without relying on pandas or external libraries.  
The goal of this mini-project is to reinforce fundamental data-handling skills by working exclusively with **lists and sublists** as table-like structures.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this notebook, you will find step-by-step examples of how to work with structured data using native Python tools. The exercises simulate common data processing tasks normally handled by pandas, but implemented manually to deepen understanding.

## 🧹 Key Operations Performed

### **1. Basic Data Cleaning**
- Removing leading/trailing spaces  
- Normalizing text values  
- Splitting and joining string fields  
- Cleaning inconsistent entries  

### **2. Data Type Adjustments**
- Converting numeric values stored as strings into integers/floats  
- Handling invalid or missing values manually  
- Validating converted data  

### **3. Creating New Variables**
- Generating new columns from existing ones  
- Simple calculations using list indices  
- Creating flags and derived metrics  

### **4. Working With Lists as Tables**
Since no dictionaries or pandas DataFrames were used, every dataset is represented as:
